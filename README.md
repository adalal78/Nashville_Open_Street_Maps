# Nashville_Open_Street_Maps
Greater Nashville, TN map study of open street maps dataset.
The data set can be found on the openstreetmap website (https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/197472).  We use the XML format
which can be found at

This project focuses on looking at the XML data set of the greater Nashville area using the Python Jupyter notebook.  We analyze
the XML data set using Python and note any inconsistencies.  We then handle these inconsistencies by exporting the data set to a csv
file.  We use the SQL3Lite to create a database of parts of the data set and analyze it.
